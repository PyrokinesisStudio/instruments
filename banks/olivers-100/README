   This is Oliver's hundred, a bank of patch files for ZynAddSubFX.
There are two bonus combination patches provided as parameter files.
I strongly encourage you to adapt these sounds to your own use and
to share your creations.

Important: many of these sounds have directions which you may view by
selecting "Edit instrument" from the advanced user interface window.

Wishing you well with your musical endeavors,
Christopher Oliver
